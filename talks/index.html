	<a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor</a> is a complete open source
	platform for building web and mobile apps in pure JavaScript. Build an
	ultra responsive app with live updating much faster than without Meteor.
	Meteor is a great option for hackathons because of its extensive library
	and package system that allow for rapid prototyping. Still not convinced?
	Well, <a href="http://status.memake.science">Status Board</a>.
