<h1>Rensselaer Hackathon Organization</h1>

<h3>Our Mission</h3>

<p>The Rensselaer Hackathon Organization's mission is to not only help
  our members attend hackathons by corrdinating travel via busses or
  carpools, but also help our memebers excel and win hackathons. We
  want to foster the growing hackathon community at RPI and create
  some truly astounding hackathon projects.</p>

<b>We are not</b>
<ul>
  <li>A computer security club, <a href="http://rpisec.org">RPI SEC</a>;
    or</li>
  <li>HackRPI, <a href="http://hackrpi.com">Rensselaer's own MLH hackathon</a>.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Hackathons</h3>

<p>Hackathons are all about hands on learning. They are usually 24-48 hour
  events hosted by other colleges. You show up to the event, think of a
  project idea that you want to make or some technology that you want to
  learn about, and spend the whole time working on it. It is the perfect
  way to get motivated to create and learn. You don't need to have any
  experience, and you dont even really need to have a finished project.</p>

<p>Some of the benefits of hackathons:
  <ul>
    <li>Free food</li>
    <li>Free shirts</li>
    <li>Smart, cool poeple to hang out with and learn from</li>
    <li>Build a cool project</li>
    <li>Build up your resume and experience</li>
    <li>Talk to companies and recruiters</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Meeting Agendas</h3>

<p>Our club meetings usually consist of discussing a few things:
  <ul>
    <li>Cordinate travel to hackathons</li>
    <li>Discuss project ideas and share technologies</li>
    <li>Form hackathon teams</li>
    <li>Present recent hackathon projects</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>We communicate with the school administrators as well as hackathon
  organizers at other events to arrange for transportation like buses,
  and set up car pools with other students. We also work with other clubs
  to help members learn new tech, and organize on campus events such as
  Hacks Out Of A Hat.</p>
