# Rensselaer Hackathon Organization

The Rensselaer Hackathon Organization's mission is twofold. The first objective is to help our members learn as much as they can and build great projects at hackathons. The second is to organize RPI's intercollegiate event, HackRPI.
  
### What is a Hackathon?

Hackathons are all about hands on learning. They are usually 24-48 hour events hosted by other colleges. You show up to the event, think of a project idea that you want to make or some technology that you want to learn about, and spend the whole time working on it. It is the perfect way to get motivated to create and learn. You don't need to have any experience, and you dont even really need to have a finished project. 

Some of the benefits of hackathons:

* Free food
* Free Shirts
* Smart, Cool people to hang out with and learn from
* Build a cool project
* Build up your resume and experience
* Talk to a bunch of companies trying to recruit you.

### What does the club do?

Our club meetings usually consist of discussing a few things:

* What hackathons we want to arrange to go to
* What cool technologies we want to work on
* Projects that we have made at recent events
* Other cool things we are interested in as a club (Club swag, programming competitions, etc)  

We communicate with the school administrators as well as hackathon organizers at other events to arrange for transportation like buses, and set up car pools with other students. We also work with other clubs to help members learn new tech, and organize on campus events such as Hacks Out Of A Hat.
