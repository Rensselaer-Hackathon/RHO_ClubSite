description: Consider yourself a competitive Pokemon player? Ever wanted to simulate a Pokemon battle without sacrificing anything in actual game play? The Pokemon Battle Simulator provides users with a simple, easy to use interface that allows Pokemon players of all skill levels to select two Pokemon to engage in a simulated battle. Users are asked to choose two different Pokemon characters from a provided list. After selecting the two Pokemon characters, the program will display the winning and losing characters. Battle results are based on simulated moves to give users an accurate prediction of actual Pokemon battle outcomes.
